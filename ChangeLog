   8/21/06   UseOA-Rose svn branch r201   Priyadarshini Malusare 
      We got CFG, CallGraph, ParamBinding, SideEffect and ReachDefs working
	  with the new DGraphRefactor in the branch.

   8/2206    UseOA-Rose svn branch r202   Priyadarshini Malusare
      ICFG refactor is working in the branch.

7/4/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r126 Michelle Strout

    - updated ParamBindings and ManagerParamBindings so that they 
      don't use isRefParam and they can handle the possibility of
      multiple procedure targets for a particular CallHandle, which
      happens with function pointers.
    - analyses that use ParamBindings and some of the old IRInterface
      stuff now have asserts.  Mostly things in the Activity/ directory.
    - Changed a lot of ExprHandles to CallHandles.
    - ./test-open64 --oa-ParamBindings TestProgs/twofunc1.B works and
      scripts/regressAll.script works in UseOA-Open64 rev 33

7/7/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r136 Barbara Kreaseck
    - added CallGraphStandard functionality:
         - stores map of CallHandle to set of ProcHandles (may Callee Procs)
         - user interface: getCalleeProcs(CallHandle c) returns an iterator
           over a set of ProcHandles that represent the may-called procs
           associated with the given CallHandle.
         - output now includes CallHandle on edges.
         - output now includes a dump of the map of CallHandles to ProcHandle
           sets
    - UseOA-Open64 regression tests have been updated to reflect extra output
    - UseOA-ROSE regression tests have not yet been updated.  Sorry ... coming.

7/14/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r141 Barbara Kreaseck
    - updated ICFGStandard functionality to use CallGraph to find procHandles
      associated with callHandles ( enables may-call analysis use).
    - updated OutputBuilder to have default parameters on the following
      functions (original functionality and calls are maintained):  
        outputString(const std::string &str, int filter=1)
	  - default parameter of 1 will filter str to change '\n' to '\\n'
	    in OutputBuilderDOT
          - a filter parameter of 0 will not filter at all
        graphNodeLabelEnd(const std::string &extras="")
          - if you send nothing, nothing extra is printed with the node
          - if you send an extra string, it will be included after the
            end of the label but before the close ']' in OutputBuilderDOT.
        graphEdgeLabelEnd(const std::string &extras="")
          - if you send nothing, nothing extra is printed with the edge
          - if you send an extra string, it will be included after the
            end of the label but before the close ']' in OutputBuilderDOT.
              samples include: 'style=dashed,color=blue'
    - works with about-to-be-committed:
        UseOA-open64 r42, UseOA-Rose r112 with rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

7/17/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r145 Priyadarshini Malusare

7/17/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r146 Barbara Kreaseck
    - re-updated OutputBuilder 
        - back to before r141 
          (undid changes to outputString,graphNodeLabelEnd,graphEdgeLabelEnd)
        - added graphSubStart and graphSubEnd functionality
    - works with about-to-be-committed: (not completely true, see r148 below)
        UseOA-open64 r43, UseOA-Rose r116 with rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

7/17/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r147 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Changed Makefile.am to include DataFlow/LocDFSet.hpp and 
      DataFlow/ICFGDFSolver.hpp 

7/17/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r148 Barbara Kreaseck
    - version r146 did not work with UseOA-open64 r43.
    - versions r147 and r148 do work with UseOA-open64 r43 (with the 
         include file changes in r147)

7/17/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r149 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Added outpt InterSideEffectStandard_output.cpp
    - Modified files:
      ChangeLog, InterSideEffectStandard.cpp, InterSideEffectStandard.hpp,
      InterSideEffectStandard_output.cpp, Makefile.am 

7/18/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r150  Michelle Strout
    - Fixed some of the logic in CalleeToCallerVisitor code.
    - Added a composeWith method to the MemRefExpr subclass RefOp.
      It handles composing a Deref with a MemRefExpr that has
      its address taken.

7/18/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r151 Priyadarshini Malusare	 
    - Added InterSideEffectStandard_output.cpp, modified
    SideEffectStandard_output.cpp 		    

7/19/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r153 Michelle Strout
    - did some fixing to ManagerAliasMapXAIF, still have an issue
      with InvisibleLocs

7/20/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r154 Michelle Strout
    - fixed the semantics of getBaseLoc for InvisibleLoc.  It can't
      return the location for the base symbol in the MRE.  Most of the
      code expects it to just return the InvisibleLoc.
      I checked all places that getBaseLoc() was being used to make
      sure that those where the expected semantics.
    - cleaned out a lot of old stuff that we are not using anymore,
      which means the Makefile.in changed and you will have to reconfigure

7/20/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r155 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Added getLocation to CalleeToCallerVisitorIRInterface, Added ProcHandle
    Callee to the constructor of CalleeToCallerVisitor, added getBaseSym for

	- Changes in createNewMRE() in the CalleeToCallerVisitor.cpp

7/20/06   OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r159 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Changes in ComposedWith in the MemRefExpr.cpp. OpenAnalysis revision 159
      has SideEffect Analysis that works for examples like simpleMix-passptr.c
      in UseOA-ROSE revision 122.

7/20/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r160 Barbara Kreaseck
    - added output(ir) routines for LocDFSet, DepDFSet and ICFGDep
    - added subGraph routines to OutputBuild* classes.
    - updated the way ICFGDep handles refParams
    - fixed bug in DGraphStandard::getSinkNodesIterator()
    - passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r45 and Useoa_Rose r122
      compiled with gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

7/22/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r161 Priyadarshini Malusare 
    -Refactored the CallGraph data-flow framework to be like the ICFG data-flow
    framework. Converted rid of CallGraphDFProblemNew.* to CallGraphDFProblem.hpp,
	CallGraphDFSolver.hpp, CallGraphDFSolver.cpp
   -Modified CallGraphDFProblem.hpp, made it similar to ICFGDFProblem.hpp,
    an abstract base class.
   -Modified CallGraphDFSolver.*pp, make them similar to ICFGDFSolver.*pp so
    that it to accept a CallGraphDFProblem as a parameter. 
   -Change all of the Managers that used to inherit from CallGraphDFProblemNew 
    so that they inherit from CallGraphDFProblem virtually. Also made it so that
	they use a CallGraphDFSolver similar to how Activity/ManagerICFGActive uses
	ICFGDFSolver. Activity/ManagerInterDep.cpp, Activity/ManagerInterDep.hpp, 
	SideEffect/ManagerInterSideEffectStandard.cpp, 
	SideEffect/ManagerInterSideEffectStandard.hpp, 
   -Passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r45 and Useoa_Rose r122  compiled with 
   gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2
	  
08/01/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r162 Priyadarshini Malusare 
    -Refactored the CFG data-flow framework to be like the ICFG data-flow
     framework. Added CFgDFProblem.hpp, CFGDFSolver.hpp, CFGDFSolver.cpp
    -Change all of the Managers that used to inherit from CFGDFProblem virtually.
     Also made it so that they use a CFGDFSolver. These Managers are as follows:
     Activity/ManagerDepStanadrd.*, Activity/ManagerVaryStandard.*. 
	 Activity/ManagerUsefulStanadard.*, ReachDefs/ManagerReachDefsStanadrd.*, 
	 ReachConsts/ManagerReachConstsStanadard.*      	 
   -Passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r50 and Useoa_Rose r127  compiled with 
    gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

08/01/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r164 Priyadarshini Malusare
   -Added ReachConstsStandard_output.cpp that was missing in the OA revision
    162.
	
08/01/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r165 Priyadarshini Malusare
   -Added CFGDFSolver.*pp that was missing in the OA revision 164.

8/01/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r166 Barbara Kreaseck
    - updated ICFG to cvs:MustMayBranch equivalent (changed output accordingly)
    - added 3 new maps to ParamBindings.*pp, with the following interface:
       +  // return an iterator over the actual ExprHandles for a call in order
       +  OA_ptr<ExprHandleIterator> 
       +  getActualExprHandleIterator(CallHandle call);
       +
       +  //! get ExprTree for actual ExprHandle
       +  OA_ptr<ExprTree> getActualExprTree(ExprHandle expr);
       +
       +  //! get actual ExprHandle in CallHandle for formal SymHandle
       +  ExprHandle getActualExprHandle(CallHandle call, SymHandle formal);
    - added output routine for ExprTree
    - added LocDFSet::calleeToCallerTransitive()
    - added LocDFSet::callerToCalleeTransitive()

    - passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r52 and UseOA_Rose r130
      compiled with gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

8/01/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r167 Michelle Strout
    Changed the handling of InvisibleLoc's in the alias analysis results
    in ManagerFIAliasAliasMap.  If a dereference to a formal parameter or 
    a global variable is in an MRE set with no named references, that set
    of MREs is mapped to a set of invisible locations (one for each MRE
    that does not have a non-formal local as the base symbol).
    regressAll works in UseOA-ROSE r131 after reverifying a number of test
    cases.  Will test with UseOA-Open64 after commit.

8/09/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r177 Michelle Strout
    When an MRE has its address taken, I call recordMRE on a clone of that
    MRE with its address not taken.  Need this because sometime analyses
    such as activity analysis will be making a query on the non-addressof
    version of that MRE.  Works with regressAll in UseOA-Open64 r55.

8/09/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r178 Barbara Kreaseck
    - updated ManagerICFGUseful to conservative working status:
       + less conservative treatment of CALL_RETURN edges still outstanding
    - LocDFSet changes:
       + callerToCallee(), callerToCalleeTransitive() and
	 calleeToCaller(), calleeToCallerTransitive() now have IRInterface
	 params, and will only be able to be called from a Manager ...
       + added a callerToCalleeNot() routine as a first attempt at 
	 determining residual locations that DO NOT get converted
	 from a caller data flow set into a member of a callee set.
    - removed deprecated Activity/ManagerInterUseful*
    - removed deprecated Activity/ManagerInterVary*
    - passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r56 and UseOA_Rose r145
      compiled with gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

8/09/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r179 Michelle Strout
    Tooks some deprecated methods out of some IRInterfaces.  Works with 
    r146 of UseOA-ROSE regressAll compiled on gcc 4.0.2.

8/10/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r180 Barbara Kreaseck
    - added Activity::inActivePerStmt output routine
    - updated ManagerICFGVaryInActive::callerToCallee to perform both
      LocDFSet::callerToCallee and LocDFSet::CallerToCalleeTransitive
    - passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r57 and UseOA_Rose r147
      compiled with gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2 on Okapi

8/11/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r182 Barbara Kreaseck
    - added Activity::InterActive output routine
    - updated ManagerICFGActive to conservative working status:
       + may conservatively marks some statements as active
    - passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r57 and UseOA_Rose r149
      compiled with gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2

8/13/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r183 Michelle Strout
   + changed setAddressTaken so that it cancels out Deref and returns the result
   Works with UseOA-ROSE trunk r151.  Going to test with UseOA-Open64 after
   commit.

8/13/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r184 Michelle Strout
    Made it so that NotationGenerator uses a MemRefExprVisitor now and
    it is capable of handling a FieldAccess.

8/13/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r185 Michelle Strout
    Minor change to make sure that USEDEF and DEFUSE are printed out
    instead of just USE or DEF.

8/15/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r186 Barbara Kreaseck
    - changed ManagerICFGUseful and UsefulStandard to store both inUseful
      and outUseful.
    - created ManagerICFGVaryActive and ActivePerStmt to find/store both
      inActive and outActive
    - updated ManagerICFGActive to use outActive to calculate active stmts
      thus no longer passing meaningful data flow sets ==> one iteration
    - removed ManagerICFGInActive and InActivePerStmt from repository
    - passes regressAll in UseOA_Open64 r63 and UseOA_Rose r152
      compiled with gcc-3.2 and rose-0.8.7a/compile-gcc-3.2 on Okapi

8/15/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r187 Barbara Kreaseck
    - updated ChangeLog to reflect correct Open64 rev number for r186 log

8/18/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r195 Luis Ramos
    - added Linearity Analysis
    - updated Makefile.am to include the new files for Linearity Analysis:
     - IRInterface/LinearityIRInterface, ExprTree/LinearityLocsVisitor
       Linearity/Interface, Linearity/LinearityPair,
       Linearity/LinearityDepsSet, Linearity/LinearityMatrixStandard
       Linearity/ManagerLinearityStandard
    - changed ExprTree.hpp class CallNode, private member is now a
      CallHandle, CallNode Constructrue now adds a CallHandle, getHandle()
      now returns a CallHandle. CallNode used to have ExprHandles.
    - this version of Linearity Analysis is still being tested, debug output
      is on by default.

8/18/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r196 Luis Ramos
    - fixed bug where the dependance chain for each statement was not pass
      to the LinearityLocsVisitor properly. It would cause a wrong result
      in where the Dataflow set did not record the complete dependance for
      a location. It now passes the inRecast of the LinearityMatrix
      Dataflow set, instead of the mLM from the exit nodes of the proc.

8/22/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r205 Luis Ramos
    - changed ManagerLinearityStandard.hpp from 
      class ManagerStandard  : private DataFlow::CFGDFProblem to
      class ManagerLinearity : public virtual DataFlow::CFGDFProblem

    - correction from r205 and r206 ManagerStandard was not change
      appropiately, it now reflects what it shoudl be, ManagerLinearity
      and ManagerReachDefsStandard respectively.

8/24/06    OpenAnalysis svn log trunk r210 Priyadarshini Malusare

    -Some routines need removed altogether.
     getCallGraphInterface*,  getDGraphInterfaceNode*,  convert_to_ICFG
    -Data structures that you need to remove altogether
     DGNodeToNodeMap mDGNodeToICFGNode, DGEdgeToEdgeMap mDGEdgeToICFGEdge;

9/1/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r222 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - OpenAnalysis r221 has all the changes for MPICFG. But there are some
      linker errors after checkout fresh copies of OpenAnalysis, UseOA-Open64
      and UseOA-ROSE. After debugging in detial in seems that the problem
      occur after including ReachConsts in the Makefile.am. I am commiting
      these changes after removing ReachConsts from the Makefile.am so that
      nobody will get stuck due to this error. 
	   
9/1/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r223 Priyadarshini Malusare

        nodes and push the Node before visiting its children.

9/13/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r235 Priyadarshini Malusare
       -Modified getDFSIterator so that it accept a parameter/root where
        where it can start DFS search.

9/13/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r236 Michelle Strout
    - Modified ManagerFIAlias so that we actually use a merge function
      as is described in the Ryder paper.

9/13/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r237 Michelle Strout
    - Small fix to the merge function.  I was not iterating over ALL of
      the mres in the unioned set.

10/26/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r245 Luis Ramos
    - Modified ExprTree.cpp output routine so that it accepts a visitor
    - Added OutputExprTreeVisitor which will visit a tree from the root
      outputing each node.

12/03/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r258 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Context-Sensitive and Flow-InSensitive Activity analysis consists
      of Def-Use Graph and Def-Use Activity Analysis. These two
      directories are combined under one directory called CSFIActivity.
    - Regenerated Makefile.am 
	
12/05/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r264 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Changed #include <OpenAnalysis/DUG/DUGStandard.hpp> to 
      #include <OpenAnalysis/CSFIActivity/DUGStandard.hpp>
    - Removed duaa and DUG directories as they are replaced by       	
      CSFIActivity.

12/06/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r266 Priyadarshini Malusare

      outgoing edges are removed when a node is removed.

12/20/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r274 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Added Check for Invisible Locations in ManagerAliasMapXAIF as 
      follows:
    - ManagerAliasMapXAIF should increament count by one or two for
      accessing array subscript. In case of array as formal reference
      parameter, array apperas as InvisibleLocation and not Subscript
      Location. Therefore, checks are added for array as Invisible
      location.
 
12/22/06    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r276 Michelle Strout
    Modified the build process so that you can use the developer script
    but you do not have to.  OpenAnalysis is set up so you don't have
    to set any environment variables and it will compile.  You can
    set the environment variables that the developer script uses or
    the typical ones like CXXFLAGS, CXX, etc.  Made this change to make
    it easier for people just starting to use OpenAnalysis, but I still
    wanted to maintain the ability to use Andy's cool developer script.
    Also added some more information to the build.log that is generated.
    It now keeps track of which version of g++ was used to do the build.

1/8/2007    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 282 Priyadarshini Malusare 
  - logic for InvisibleLoc is used to ensure two MemRefExprs in the same
    set that only differs with respect to accuracy i.e. (one shows
    up as PartialAccuracy and other as FullAccuracy) are mapped to the 
    same location. e.g. following 2 MREs should be mapped to the same
    location i.e. Location with partial Accuracy conservatively.

1/11/2007   OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 283 Luis Ramos
  - Modified LinearityAnalysis so that it follows the transitive rule

1/19/2007   OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 284 Luis Ramos
  - Fixed LinearityAnalysis problems and now correctly performs the
    analysis. 
  - Fixed Clone routine, Operator!=, Operator==, added
    if(debug)'s. 
  - Fixed the output routines for Linearity and the
    debug output. 
  - Fixed Linearity so that CFGDFProblem/Solver were 
    correctly using it.
  - Added new regression tests for Linearity and added Linearity to
    regressAll.

1/23/04    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 285 Priyadarshini Malusare

  - Partial Accuracy is represented by instance of SubSetRef class.
  - Full Accuracy is represented by corresponding MemRefExpr.
  - Please refer following link on the wiki.
    http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/OpenAnalysisWiki/moin.cgi/Location_20class

2/13/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 299 Priyadarshini Malusare
  - Modified CSFIActivity Analysis to output correct Active Symbols.
    removed code that was using Alias Analysis as Alias Analysis is 
    not Context-Sensitive we can not use it to get correct Locations.

2/14/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 306 Andy Stone
    - Seperated classes in Location/ into seperate files.

2/15/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 307 Andy Stone
    - Added affine expression manager, package, and IR interface.
    - Added loop abstraction.
    - Added DataDep manager, package, and IR interface.
    - Added the IdxExprAccess class.
    - Note: These packages are not yet complete.

2/28/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 309 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Added InterActiveFortran class as a seperate interface for
      Context-Sensitive-Flow-InSensitive Activity Analysis.
    - This is temporary adjustment for Appliactions like OpenAD
      until we get Context-Sensitive Alias Analysis wotrking.
    - We still maintain InterActive.* as an interface for 
      Flow-Sensitive-Context-InSensitive Activity Analysis.
    - Please refer berlios bug #10522.

03/02/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 311 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Added Active MemRefHandles and Active Statements for CSFI
      Activity Analysis.

03/06/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 317 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Cleaned Following Classes for operator< and operator==.
    - MemRefExpr.cpp, LocFieldSubSet.cpp, LocIdxSubSet.cpp,
      LocSet.cpp, NamedLoc.cpp, UnknownLoc.cpp, UnnamedLoc.cpp

03/15/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 326 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Fixed ManagerICFGvaryActive::callToReturn and 
      ManagerICFGUseful::callToReturn so that it would kill all
      the non-local variables along the Call_Return_Edge.
    - This modification is doneto improve the precision of the 
      CIFS Activity Analysis.
    - Also, ManagerICFG.cpp is Fixed so that CALL_RETURN_EDGE would
      have valid CallHandle instead of CallHandle(0).

04/14/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r 346 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Modification in AliasMapXAIF so that it will generate multiple
      virtual locations for InvisibleLoc::SubSetRef and single Virtual
      Location for InvisibleLoc::Deref.

04/15/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r352 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Changed UnnamedRef(memRefType, StmtHandle) to                                   UnnamedRef(memRefType, StmtHandle).
    - Changed UnnamedLoc(StmtHandle , ....) to                                        UnnamedLoc(ExprHandle , ....) 

04/17/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r356 Barbara Kreaseck
    - Changed subgraph output to create a cluster label that is
      compatible with Dot (removed any inclusive prefixes using
      ::).  Subgraphs will now print enclosed within boxes again.
    - cosmetic changes in ICFG.hpp
    - This triggers the need for re-generating any regression
      output files that print Dot output.

04/25/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r367 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Modified the output of LocFieldSubSet.

05/18/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r397 Michelle Strout
    Performance debugging.
    - logic in AliasMap addLocation is not correct wrt MAYALIAS,
      subclasses of LocSubSet are full accurate
    - making an AliasMap set MAYALIAS anytime two or more locations are put
      in it or a SubSetLoc with partial accuracy or an invisible loc with
      an MRE with partial accuracy.
    - took out some code in addLocation that was sequentially looping through
      the mLocToIdMap for a location instead of just doing a lookup.
    - works with both UseOA-ROSE and UseOA-Open64 regressAll.  Need to
      rerun UseOA-ROSE genFIAliasAliasMap because the changes actually
      improved the precision of the results.

05/21/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r405 Luis Ramos
    - Added RIFG.cpp/hpp and NestedSCR.cpp/hpp with updated source for used
      with HPCToolkit.
    - Modified Makefile.am to include RIFG and NestedSCR under Utils.

    for autoconf 2.6+ compatibility.

05/30/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r409/410 Barbara Kreaseck
    - added iter counts to InterActive, with interface routines
      This triggers re-gen of ICFGActive regression output in both
      UseOA-Open64 and UseOA-Rose (to follow shortly).
    - cleaned up ManagerICFGActive.*pp:  no data flow on this analysis so
      all callbacks that receive an in-set and return an out-set no longer
      convert the dfset, and just return the in-set.  Also, added some flags
      to minimize location processing when we already know a memref is active
      or when we already know a stmt is active.
    - minor clean-up in ManagerICFGUseful.hpp, ManagerICFGVaryActive.cpp

06/08/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r415 Barbara Kreaseck
    - corrected LocDFSet copy constructor: used to wrongly copy map.  
      Now map is not copied, valid flag is set to false, and map will
      be re-created when needed.  This affects LocDFSet::clone().
    - passes regressAll on UseOA-ROSE r295, UseOA-Open64 r177, MPICFG r415

06/26/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r427 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Removed DGraphIterative.*hpp.
    - Added generic class DGraphSolverDFP.*pp that selects
      Iterative and WorkList algorithm for DataFlow Analysis based on
      the option specified by the user.

      and WOrkListPQueue.

06/27/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r432 Priyadarshini Malusare
    - Clean-up CSFIActivity to remove InterAlias in the parameter
      list of performAnalysis.

07/01/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r435 Priyadarshini Malusare
   - Added scope(local/nonlocal) for UnnamedRef. 

07/03/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r436 Priyadarshini Malusare
   - Two InvisibleLocations mayOverlap if:
     a. Number of Derefs are same.
     b. Same SymHandle for innermost MRE.

07/03/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r437 Priyadarshini Malusare
   - Modified ManagerFIAliasAliasMap.* to improve the performance of 
     AliasAnalysis.
   - These maps are made local.
     std::map<int,bool> foundNonVisibleRef, 
     std::map<int,bool> foundVisibleFixedLoc;
     std::map<int,int>  LocsetIdToAliasMapId;
   - Removed maps.
     std::map<ProcHandle, std::map<int,int> > setIdToNumLocs;
     std::map<int,std::set<OA_ptr<MemRefExpr> > > ufSetToMREs;

07/06/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r438 Priyadarshini Malusare
   - Added code in ManagerICFGUseful::callerToCallee and 
     ManagerICFGVaryActive::callerToCallee to handle useful
     and varied global variables.

07/06/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r439 Priyadarshini Malusare
   - Modified AliasMapXAIF so that address range does not start
     with 0 for LocSubSet.

07/11/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r442 Priyadarshini Malusare
   - ManagerFIAlias::InvisibleLocationVisitor visitIdxAccess, 
     visitExprAcess, visitFieldAccess constructor second parameter
     is modified ti reflect correct field and index information.

07/18/07    OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r445 Barbara Kreaseck
   - Added get/set routines for number of iteration for active
     analysis within InterActiveFortran.*pp
   - Added debugging statements to other changed files.

07/24/07   OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r446 Brian White
   - Added ManagerFIAliasReachable that implements Ryder's
     FIAlias, but only visits functions/methods deemed reachable
     as part of the analysis.  This involved some repackaging
     of FIAlias internals.

   - Commented out assertion in SubSetRef::composeWith
	         //    assert(! mre->isaAddressOf() );
     sent e-mail to Priya

   - Changed ManagerFIAliasAliasMap.cpp to add extra IdSets for
     NamedRef's and local UnnamedRef's that are also in MayAlias
     IdSets after unification.  This allows them to have mustLocs
     for when they are the lhs of assignments, etc.

08/14/07   OpenAnalysis svn tag trunk r460 Priyadarshini Malusare

  - Fixed following bugs in the ManagerFIAliasAliasTag.cpp
    - Replaced mapIter->first by ufset->Find(mapIter->first)
      in order to make sure that we are not looking for the old
      representative set.

  - added toString routines to DataFlowSetImpl class
  - removed assert(!universalSet) from DataFlowSetImplIterator constructor
      + for some DataFlowSetImpl, the iterator will be the only accessor, and
        having a universal set may be reasonable.
  - added a isUniversalSetIter() method to query situation instead
  - incremental changes to RCPair, RCPairSet, ReachConsts, ManagerICFGReachConsts
      + they compile but are not ready for prime time yet
  - renamed RCPairTest.cpp to driver_RCPairTest.cpp

  - RCPairSet testing complete
  - Changed ReachConsts::Interface to query based upon StmtHandle/AliasTagSet
    or CallHandle/AliasTagSet, and associated ReachConstsStandard
  - Consequently updated EvalToConstVisitor to work with above
  - Updated ManagerICFGReachConsts to work with new Interface

  - ManagerICFGReachConsts::transfer() and ::callTransfer() are returning
    Universal outSets when they receive Universal inSets.  This is due
    to reversePostDFS ordering and CallToReturn edges sending UniversalSets
    due to ReachConsts being a Intersection MEET analysis.
